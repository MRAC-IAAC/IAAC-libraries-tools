# IAAC-Libraries-Tools
The IAAC GitHub Organization unifies robotics and design with templates, hardware drivers (cameras, LiDAR, ROS), and support for robotic arms, mobile robots, and drones. It includes tools for 3D reconstruction, navigation, and Python libraries for vision and machine learning, plus tutorials on Linux, Docker, and ROS.
